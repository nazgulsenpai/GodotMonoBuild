# GodotMonoBuild
Simple Python script to pull Godot from Git and build Godot with Mono binaries for tools and export. For my own personal use but maybe someone would find it helpful. It has hardcoded paths and is Windows only so don't say I didn't warn you when you inevitably want to gouge your eyes out after looking at it.
